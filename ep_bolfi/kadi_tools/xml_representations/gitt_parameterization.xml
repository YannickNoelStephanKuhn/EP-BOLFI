  <param description="If set to True, the features will be treated differently. The goal is better behaviour in cases where the initial unknowns' 95% confidence boundaries are already pretty close to the best possible fit. The method is to mostly disable EP, as it is allowing BOLFI to treat the features one-by-one, introducing the possibility that one feature will shrink the confidence boundaries enough such that the next feature is not contained within these boundaries anymore. Instead, BOLFI will fit the vector of all features at once." type="bool" name="convergence-mode" char="c" default="false"/>
