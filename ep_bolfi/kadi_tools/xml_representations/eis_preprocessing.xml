  <param description="File name of the model parameters. It must be a Python file and contain the following global variables:&#10;&#10; - parameters: The dictionary of parameters to pass on to the solver. May be a ep_bolfi.utility.preprocessing.SubstitutionDict.&#10;&#10; - unknowns: The dictionary of unknown parameters. Instead of single values as in 'parameters', input 2-tuples with their lower and upper bounds, e.g. from literature.&#10;&#10;It may contain the additional following global variables:&#10;&#10; - transform_unknowns: Dictionary for transforming unknowns before inferring them via a normal distribution. Either give as 2-tuples with the first entry being the back-transformation and the second one being the transformation. For convenience, putting 'log' gives log-normal distributions.&#10;&#10; - uncertainties: The dictionary of parameter uncertainties. Used for scrambling them in the simulation samples. Give them as tuples: the first entry is the name of the distribution in scipy.stats, and the following are its parameters. Example: ('norm', mean, std)." type="string" name="parameters-file" char="q" required="true"/>

  <param description="With 'None', does nothing (i.e., cell potentials are used). If set to either 'positive' or 'negative', instead of cell potentials, the base for the displayed voltage will be the potential of the 'positive' or 'negative' electrode against a reference electrode.
